ceaser cipher
goal = take a message and encrypt it by shifting every letter by the
same value in its location in the alphabet, or vise versa- decrypt 


if the shift is equal to 0
return false
if shift is greater than 25
return false
if shift is less than -25
return false

the encryped message will be put into a string called solved
all letters in the string will changed to lowercase


if encode is true: encrypting

loop through each character in the string
asciNum is the number associated with inidividual characters in the string
newAsciNum is the asciNum for each letter plus the shift entered

if the asciNum is less than or equal to 32 and also less than or equal to 47 then:
dont add the shift just leave it as it is

if the newAsciNum is greater than 122(z)
then subtract 26 to get to the beginning of the alphabet

if newAsciNum is less than 97 
then add 26 to get to the correct letter

otherwise, change each letter in the string to its AsciNumber and add the shift
and then change back to new letter

if encode is false: decrypting

loop through each character in the string
asciNum is the number associated with inidividual characters in the string
newAsciNum is the asciNum for each letter MINUS the shift entered

if the asciNum is less than or equal to 32 and also less than or equal to 47 then:
dont add the shift just leave it as it is

if the newAsciNum is greater than 122(z)
then subtract 26 to get to the beginning of the alphabet

if newAsciNum is less than 97 
then add 26 to get to the correct letter

otherwise, change each letter in the string to its AsciNumber and add the shift
and then change back to new letter
