Polybius square Cipher
The purpose is to decode a message where each letter is represented by a certain number

First, I well create an alphabet array and assign a value to each letter as objects

create a variable "solved" to hold the encoded message.
Then create "word" variable to change all letter to uppercase

Then I need to loop through the alphabet
if the letter matches the letter in the string, return the number
