/*If the shift value is not present, equal to 0,
 less than -25, or greater than 25, the function

Spaces should be maintained throughout, as should other non-alphabetic symbols.
Capital letters can be ignored.
If a letter is shifted so that it goes "off" the alphabet (e.g. a shift of 3 on the letter "z"),
 it should wrap around to the front of the alphabet (e.g. "z" becomes "c"). Write your tests here!*/
